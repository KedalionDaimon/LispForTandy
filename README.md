# LispForTandy
Ported Lisp in BASIC to Tandy TRS-80 Model 100 (Kyocera KC-85 family), originally written by Randy Beer 1981.

As discussed here:

This is a port of a Lisp system written in BASIC by Randy Beer 1981. 

The source I used was this:

The issues of March and April of this magazine (particularly March) were the original publishing place of his code:

I made minor adjustments to the code and slight error corrections to facilitate its operation on the Tandy TRS-80 Model 100. So far, I have run in under emulation in Virtual T:

Have fun! :)
